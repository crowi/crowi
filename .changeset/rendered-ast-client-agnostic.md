Make `renderedAst` a client-agnostic typed contract (RFC-0023). Renderer producers (shiki, KaTeX, Mermaid, PlantUML, link cards, placeholders) now stamp typed sidecar data onto the byte-identical `html` nodes they already emit, and clients that declare `X-Crowi-Ast-Version: 1` receive a validated `{astVersion, root}` envelope in which those nodes are projected into typed nodes (`code` with themed tokens, `math`/`inlineMath` with TeX source, `crowiDiagram` with intrinsic dimensions, `crowiLinkCard`, `crowiPlaceholder`) — the foundation for native (non-HTML) rendering such as the iOS app. Requests without the header — including the web, permanently — keep receiving the stored bare mdast Root verbatim, so existing clients and open tabs are unaffected. Responses now also carry `renderedAstArtifactKey`, which fixes a web bug where a pending diagram that finished rendering (or a freshness-mismatch recompute) was not re-drawn on refetch because the render memo only keyed on the revision id. Operators: this release bumps the renderer pipeline to 1.0.0 and removes the missing-version freshness special case — run the new `crowi-admin rebuild rendered-ast` (real writes) immediately after deploying, and use `--dry-run` only before that; see the admin guide's "rebuild rendered-ast" section for the rollout and completion procedure.
