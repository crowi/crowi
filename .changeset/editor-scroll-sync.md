The `/_edit` page now uses a layout that fills the whole viewport, with the editing header and save footer pinned to the screen while the editor and preview each scroll independently inside.

In addition, **bidirectional scroll sync** between editor and preview is implemented. Rather than legacy Crowi's simple proportional scrollTop, it syncs via fractional-line interpolation combining line + in-block offset ratio, so it follows continuously even inside long blocks like code fences or lists instead of snapping to the top of a line. The server embeds `data-source-line` on each top-level node of the preview mdast (`POST /api/v2/pages/preview`), and the web-side `useScrollSync` hook bridges those markers to CodeMirror's line-block info with linear interpolation. The editor → preview / preview → editor round-trip is a bijection, so the position doesn't drift as you move back and forth.
