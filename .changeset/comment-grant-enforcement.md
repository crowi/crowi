Enforce page permissions on comment read and delete.

`GET /api/v2/comments` now grant-checks the owning page (resolved from `page_id`, or from the revision's page for `revision_id`) before returning comment bodies, and returns 404 (hiding existence) to callers who cannot read the page. Previously any authenticated user could read the comments of any private page or revision by id. `DELETE /api/v2/comments` now also verifies the target comment actually belongs to the supplied `page_id`, so a user granted on one page can no longer delete a comment on a page they cannot access by passing a mismatched id. The comment list route gains a `404` response in its contract.
