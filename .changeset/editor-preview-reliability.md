Harden the realtime collaborative editor against data loss and external-edit divergence. This is the full implementation of the reliability work: alpha.2 shipped only a small seed of external-edit invalidation under an over-scoped changeset, and the complete implementation (a ~5k-line overhaul across `@crowi/collab` and the api collab host) lands here.

Guard the Yjs document state against shrink and loss: compaction never replaces a document with a smaller or empty state, the document's base revision is persisted so a reconnecting client re-materialises from the correct revision body, and an empty-load fallback rebuilds the doc from the stored revision instead of starting blank.

External (REST / MCP / in-process) edits now invalidate a live collab session in the same api process: after the page commits, Crowi broadcasts a force-reload, tombstones the document so an in-flight stale save is rejected with a reload prompt instead of CONFLICT-looping, gates reconnects so they re-materialise from the new revision, and drains the stale connections (a force-reload was previously a no-op while any client stayed connected). Two concurrent same-process saves carrying a byte-identical body now coalesce into a single success with the loser recorded as a contributor, while a genuine divergence still surfaces as CONFLICT so the user reloads.

Multi-instance / out-of-process external edits (a live doc on another replica, or an admin-CLI DB-direct edit) remain a documented limitation requiring a future cross-instance invalidation channel; a single api instance is recommended (see the realtime-collab operations doc).
