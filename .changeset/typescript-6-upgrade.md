Upgrade TypeScript 5.8 → 6.0 across the whole workspace catalog, plus the two tools whose own peer ranges gated it: `ts-jest` 29.3 → 29.4 (the current version still excluded TS 6) and `@typescript-eslint` 6.21 → 8.68 (moved into the catalog so all five workspaces that declare it directly stay in lockstep). `eslint` itself is untouched, jest stays on the same major, and TypeScript 7 (a native/Go rewrite still landing ecosystem-wide support) is out of scope — this bump is the sanctioned bridge release for that eventual move.

Runtime behavior and every public type/API shape are unchanged; the generated `.d.ts` output was diffed against the pre-upgrade build across all 316 declaration files and the only differences found were union-member reordering (an internal declaration-emitter artifact, byte-identical content once sorted) with zero content changes.

Two compiler-level fallouts were absorbed without weakening `strict` or any other type-safety setting:

- TS 6 hard-errors on two now-deprecated `tsconfig` options that will disappear in TS 7 (`moduleResolution: "node"` and any `baseUrl`, the latter also implicitly injected by `tsup`'s own declaration bundler on every workspace that ships a `.d.ts`). The shared `tsconfig/base.json` now sets `ignoreDeprecations: "6.0"`, which is TypeScript's own documented bridge flag for this exact transitional release; actually migrating off these options is real resolution-strategy work that belongs with the eventual TS 7 move, not this version bump.
- TS 6 stopped auto-including `@types/*` packages for workspaces using `moduleResolution: "bundler"` unless a tsconfig's `types` array names them explicitly. Several `library.json`-based packages picked up this newly-required `types: ["node"]` / `types: ["jest", "node"]`, matching the explicit-`types` convention several sibling packages (`svg-sanitize`, `admin-cli`, the search plugins, etc.) already used for the same reason.

`@typescript-eslint` 8's `recommended` preset also added `no-require-imports` (superseding the deprecated `no-var-requires` most call sites already had a justified `eslint-disable` comment for) and tightened `no-empty-object-type` against empty `interface X extends Y {}` declarations. Every new diagnostic was resolved individually: existing suppression comments were extended to cover the new rule name, a handful of genuinely dead/redundant `require()` calls were deleted, two `require()` calls were converted to static imports, and three `Pick<...>`-only marker interfaces became plain type aliases (a mechanical, meaning-preserving rewrite, not a design change).

`@crowi/web` and `@crowi/site` lint through `eslint-config-next`, which bundles its own `typescript-eslint` dependency rather than reading the workspace catalog. That bundled copy (8.53.0) declared `typescript: >=4.8.4 <6.0.0`, a TS6-excluding range. A `pnpm.overrides` entry (`"typescript-eslint@<8.68.0": "8.68.0"`) forces it to the same 8.68.0 already used directly by the five workspaces above, whose peer range (`>=4.8.4 <6.1.0`) accepts TS 6. No new lint errors surfaced in either workspace after the bump.

One TS6-excluding tool remains in the graph with no available fix: `openapi-typescript` 7.13.0 (used only by `@crowi/api-contract`'s dev-time OpenAPI-types codegen script, `scripts/generate-openapi-types.ts`) declares `typescript: ^5.x`, and 7.13.0 is still the latest release. This surfaces only as a non-fatal `pnpm install` peer-dependency warning — pnpm does not fail installs on unmet peers by default, and the tool isn't part of `type-check` / `build` / `test` / `lint`. It was verified functionally: `pnpm --filter @crowi/api-contract generate` runs clean under TS 6, and `pnpm check:openapi` confirms the regenerated artifacts are byte-identical to the committed ones. Revisit once openapi-typescript ships a TS6-compatible release.
