Narrow the plugin SDK's trust boundary: remove `ctx.crypto` and gate `ctx.model()` behind a declared allow-list.

BREAKING (`@crowi/plugin-api`): `PluginContext.crypto` (and the `PluginCrypto` type) is removed. It exposed the same global `CROWI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`-derived encrypt/decrypt used for core's sensitive Config and every other plugin's `@sensitive` fields, so any installed plugin could decrypt any other plugin's or core's secrets. No first-party plugin used it — the legitimate way to read a plugin's own `@sensitive` config values is unchanged: `ctx.config<T>()` already returns them transparently decrypted.

`ctx.model(name)` now requires the plugin to declare the model in a new `CrowiPlugin.modelAccess?: string[]` field (same shape as `requires`). Calling `ctx.model()` for an undeclared model throws `Plugin '<name>' called model('<requested>') but did not declare it in 'modelAccess'.` A model listed in `modelAccess` still gets full (unrestricted) read/write access — there is no read-only mode yet. `PluginManager.activate()` validates every declared model name against the registered core models at boot and fails loudly (isolating just that plugin, same as a bad `configSchema`) on an unknown name.

`GET /admin/plugins` now includes each plugin's declared `modelAccess` in `PluginInfo`, so an admin can audit which plugins touch which core collections.

The four first-party plugins that call `ctx.model()` (`@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch`, `@crowi/plugin-search-mongo`, `@crowi/plugin-search-opensearch`, `@crowi/plugin-slack`) now declare their actual (read-only) usage: `['Page', 'Bookmark', 'User']` for the ES/OpenSearch drivers, `['Page', 'Revision']` for the Mongo driver, `['Page']` for Slack.
