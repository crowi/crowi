Fix other users' draft pages leaking into the page list. The `include_deleted` query param used `z.coerce.boolean()`, which is JS `Boolean(v)` — so the string `"false"` (how the web client serialises `false` on the query string) coerced to `true`. That flipped `include_deleted` on for every listing request, making the server skip the draft/status visibility filter and return drafts owned by anyone, not just the viewer. The param now parses the string explicitly so only `"true"` / `true` is truthy.
