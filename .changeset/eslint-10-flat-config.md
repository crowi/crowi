Migrate the last 4 eslintrc-based configs (the repo root, `@crowi/api`, `@crowi/collab`, `@crowi/plugin-search-mongo`) to flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`), so every workspace in the repo now lints through the same config format that `@crowi/web` and `@crowi/site` already used. `eslint` itself moves into the pnpm catalog at `^9.39.5`, so all 7 linted workspaces share one version instead of the previous 8.57.1/9 split.

This is dev tooling only — no runtime behavior, public type, or API shape changes. Every workspace's lint output was diffed line-by-line against the pre-migration baseline and came back identical (0 errors, same warnings, same files, same line numbers), including `@crowi/api`'s guard rules that block ad hoc test-file DB connections and direct Redis `.duplicate()` calls outside the one helper that installs an error listener first — those guards were restructured from 3 eslintrc override blocks down to 2 flat-config entries (flat config turned out to share eslintrc's "later config replaces, not merges, a repeated rule key" behavior, so the restructuring is a smaller version of the same workaround, not a different one) and their existing regression test (`packages/api/src/test/eslint-db-guard.test.ts`) still passes unmodified assertion-for-assertion, now driving the real flat config via ESLint's Node API with `cwd`-only discovery instead of the removed `useEslintrc` option.

`eslint` stays on the 9.x series rather than moving to 10: `eslint-config-next` (used by `@crowi/web` and `@crowi/site`) pins `eslint-plugin-react`, whose latest release (7.37.5) calls two APIs ESLint 10 removed outright, so linting a `.tsx` file crashes rather than warns. There is currently no published `eslint-config-next` release that resolves this. Flat config is unaffected by that gap — ESLint 9 already reads it natively — so this migration removes eslintrc from the repo entirely without waiting on the upstream fix; bumping to ESLint 10 later is a single catalog version change once `eslint-plugin-react` supports it.
