`GRANT_RESTRICTED` ("Anyone with the link") pages now actually work like a link-share invite. Opening a restricted page's id URL (`/<page._id>`, and the revived legacy `/_r/<page._id>` short link) via `IdRedirector` adds the visitor to the page's `grantedUsers` on first visit, so a follow-up direct visit to the page's real path — or from the list/search — no longer 404s. Previously `GRANT_RESTRICTED` behaved like `GRANT_SPECIFIED` for anyone who hadn't already been added, silently breaking the promise made by the link-share popover.

The grant-on-first-access write is confined to a new `POST /pages/link-access` endpoint called only by `IdRedirector`: it is web-session only (OAuth/PAT tokens are rejected before the per-user rate limiter counts them), rate-limited at 30 req/min/user, and atomic (a concurrent grant change or soft-delete can never be raced into an invite). `GET /pages?page_id=` and every other by-id caller (`/_edit`, `/_attachments`, comment/bookmark/watch helpers) are unchanged — visiting those does not grant access.

Also fixes a search-index visibility gap surfaced while implementing this: search results could include stale hits for soft-deleted / redirect-stub pages, and the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch drivers now exclude `wip` / `deprecated` pages from the index (matching list visibility) instead of leaving them as permanent dead hits.
