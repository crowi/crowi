BREAKING: `GET /admin/plugins/readiness`'s response shape changes from a plugin-only `{ name, adminPlacement, fields }` issue to a generic `{ id, source: 'plugin' | 'core', label, href, fields }` issue, so this admin-only endpoint's existing contract is not backward compatible for any client parsing the old field names. There is no server-side alias for the old shape. The endpoint path, auth (admin-only JWT), and the underlying "unset field" semantics are unchanged; `@crowi/web`'s own consumer of this endpoint is updated in the same release.

Admin readiness now also covers core mail configuration, and test-send errors no longer leak internal details to the browser.

- The `mail:from` sender address (a core setting, not a plugin one) now participates in the same admin readiness check that already covered storage/search plugin config: when it's unset, admins see it in the shared readiness banner (on every wiki page and `/admin/plugins`) with a link straight to `/admin/mail`.
- `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp` (`host`) and `@crowi/plugin-mail-resend` (`apiKey`) now declare `readiness` too, so an incomplete SMTP or Resend setup is caught the same way S3/Elasticsearch/OpenSearch already are. AWS SES intentionally declares none — its credentials fall back to the AWS SDK default credential chain, which is a legitimate empty configuration.
- `mail:from` and the active mail driver's required fields are independent issues — either one being unset keeps mail flagged as not ready.
- A test-send failure caused by an unset `mail:from` now returns a dedicated `MAIL_FROM_NOT_CONFIGURED` error with a localized explanation and a link back to mail settings, instead of a generic failure. Any other sender/transport failure (e.g. a connection error or bad credentials) is logged on the server only — the browser only ever sees a safe, localized generic message, never the raw exception text.
