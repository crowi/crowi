## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- ba38a7e: Upgrade `jest` / `@types/jest` / `jest-environment-node` from the 29.x series to 30.5.0 / 30.0.0 / 30.5.0 across the 16 workspaces that share these versions through the pnpm catalog. `ts-jest` stays on 29.4.12 (already accepts `jest@^30`) and `packages/web`'s vitest stack is untouched — this is a test-tooling-only change with no observable behavior difference for users of any of these packages.

  `@crowi/api`'s three custom Jest extension points (the `CrowiEnvironment` test environment's `handleTestEvent`, the `FailureTaxonomyReporter`'s `onTestResult`/`onRunComplete`, and `globalSetup`'s MongoDB connection resolution) were individually verified against jest 30 and continue to work unchanged, as does the `--no-sparkplug` Node 24 V8 workaround the api's test script depends on.

- a334308: Upgrade TypeScript 5.8 → 6.0 across the whole workspace catalog, plus the two tools whose own peer ranges gated it: `ts-jest` 29.3 → 29.4 (the current version still excluded TS 6) and `@typescript-eslint` 6.21 → 8.68 (moved into the catalog so all five workspaces that declare it directly stay in lockstep). `eslint` itself is untouched, jest stays on the same major, and TypeScript 7 (a native/Go rewrite still landing ecosystem-wide support) is out of scope — this bump is the sanctioned bridge release for that eventual move.

  Runtime behavior and every public type/API shape are unchanged; the generated `.d.ts` output was diffed against the pre-upgrade build across all 316 declaration files and the only differences found were union-member reordering (an internal declaration-emitter artifact, byte-identical content once sorted) with zero content changes.

  Two compiler-level fallouts were absorbed without weakening `strict` or any other type-safety setting:

  - TS 6 hard-errors on two now-deprecated `tsconfig` options that will disappear in TS 7 (`moduleResolution: "node"` and any `baseUrl`, the latter also implicitly injected by `tsup`'s own declaration bundler on every workspace that ships a `.d.ts`). The shared `tsconfig/base.json` now sets `ignoreDeprecations: "6.0"`, which is TypeScript's own documented bridge flag for this exact transitional release; actually migrating off these options is real resolution-strategy work that belongs with the eventual TS 7 move, not this version bump.
  - TS 6 stopped auto-including `@types/*` packages for workspaces using `moduleResolution: "bundler"` unless a tsconfig's `types` array names them explicitly. Several `library.json`-based packages picked up this newly-required `types: ["node"]` / `types: ["jest", "node"]`, matching the explicit-`types` convention several sibling packages (`svg-sanitize`, `admin-cli`, the search plugins, etc.) already used for the same reason.

  `@typescript-eslint` 8's `recommended` preset also added `no-require-imports` (superseding the deprecated `no-var-requires` most call sites already had a justified `eslint-disable` comment for) and tightened `no-empty-object-type` against empty `interface X extends Y {}` declarations. Every new diagnostic was resolved individually: existing suppression comments were extended to cover the new rule name, a handful of genuinely dead/redundant `require()` calls were deleted, two `require()` calls were converted to static imports, and three `Pick<...>`-only marker interfaces became plain type aliases (a mechanical, meaning-preserving rewrite, not a design change).

  `@crowi/web` and `@crowi/site` lint through `eslint-config-next`, which bundles its own `typescript-eslint` dependency rather than reading the workspace catalog. That bundled copy (8.53.0) declared `typescript: >=4.8.4 <6.0.0`, a TS6-excluding range. A `pnpm.overrides` entry (`"typescript-eslint@<8.68.0": "8.68.0"`) forces it to the same 8.68.0 already used directly by the five workspaces above, whose peer range (`>=4.8.4 <6.1.0`) accepts TS 6. No new lint errors surfaced in either workspace after the bump.

  One TS6-excluding tool remains in the graph with no available fix: `openapi-typescript` 7.13.0 (used only by `@crowi/api-contract`'s dev-time OpenAPI-types codegen script, `scripts/generate-openapi-types.ts`) declares `typescript: ^5.x`, and 7.13.0 is still the latest release. This surfaces only as a non-fatal `pnpm install` peer-dependency warning — pnpm does not fail installs on unmet peers by default, and the tool isn't part of `type-check` / `build` / `test` / `lint`. It was verified functionally: `pnpm --filter @crowi/api-contract generate` runs clean under TS 6, and `pnpm check:openapi` confirms the regenerated artifacts are byte-identical to the committed ones. Revisit once openapi-typescript ships a TS6-compatible release.

### Minor Changes

- 9a06104: Add sign-in with Google, as a plugin (RFC-0014). Enable `@crowi/plugin-google` in your runner project, paste a Client ID and secret into the admin plugin screen, and a "Sign in with Google" button appears on the sign-in page without a restart. A first-time federated sign-in picks a username before an account is created, and then follows the instance's registration mode — active immediately when registration is Open, queued for administrator approval when Restricted, refused when Closed. Signed-in users can connect and disconnect providers from Settings, and an unlink is refused when it would leave the account with no way to sign back in. Google gets no special treatment in core: the whole flow (provider list / start / callback / handoff, signed state cookies, PKCE, OIDC verification) is generic, backed by a new auth-driver plugin SDK and a `UserIdentity` linking model, so any other OIDC provider can be added the same way. An email address is honoured only when the provider asserts it is verified, and one that matches an existing local account is never auto-linked — that sign-in is refused, and linking has to be done deliberately from Settings. Requires `AUTH_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` (or `CLIENT_URL`) to be set; see the "Signing in with an external account" operations guide for setup.
