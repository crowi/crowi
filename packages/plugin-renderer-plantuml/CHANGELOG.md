# @crowi/plugin-renderer-plantuml

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- 1825a1a: The shared SVG sanitizer moved from the published `@crowi/plugin-renderer-svg-sanitize` package to a private, internal-only `@crowi/svg-sanitize` package that is now bundled directly into each renderer's `dist` at build time instead of being installed as a runtime dependency. Sanitization behaviour is unchanged; only the dependency graph of the published package changed (the workspace dependency moved to `devDependencies`, and `@xmldom/xmldom` is now declared directly as a `dependencies` entry of each renderer instead of being resolved transitively).

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- ff63cd1: Declare an explicit `zod` peer dependency range (`^4`) instead of `catalog:`. pnpm does not resolve the `catalog:` protocol inside `peerDependencies` during a workspace/source install, so building Crowi from source emitted a spurious `unmet peer zod@catalog:` warning for every plugin. Published packages were already correct (pnpm rewrites `catalog:` to a concrete range on publish), so npm consumers were unaffected — this only silences the noisy source/Docker-build install. Declaring `^4` also more honestly states that the plugins are compatible with any zod 4.x the host application provides.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- a52d03f: Initial publish preparation: monorepo restructure complete (RFC-0002 →
  feature-monorepo-packages-restructure). All packages now use
  workspace: protocol internally, peerDependencies for plugin boundaries,
  shared @crowi/tsconfig presets, and a publish-ready layout under
  packages/\*.
