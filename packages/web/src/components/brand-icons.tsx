/**
 * Vendor brand marks, as inline SVG.
 *
 * These exist because lucide-react — the icon set everything else here
 * draws from — has no Google mark, and using its `Chrome` icon for an
 * auth provider would name the wrong product. Google's own sign-in
 * branding guidelines require the official multi-colour "G" on a "Sign
 * in with Google" control, so a generic key or lock icon is not an
 * option either.
 *
 * They are deliberately inline rather than fetched from the provider's
 * CDN (which the federated-auth contract's `iconUrl` would allow): a
 * remote logo makes the sign-in screen depend on a third-party host
 * being reachable, and tells that host who is looking at the page
 * before anyone has chosen to sign in with it.
 *
 * Brand colours are fixed and do NOT follow the theme — a vendor mark
 * recoloured to match the surrounding UI stops being the vendor's mark.
 * Each accepts only `className` so it drops into the same slots as a
 * `LucideIcon` (see `BrandOrLucideIcon` in `admin/admin-sidebar.tsx`).
