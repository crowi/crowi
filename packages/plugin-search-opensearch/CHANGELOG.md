## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- 8ff0e64: Narrow the plugin SDK's trust boundary: remove `ctx.crypto` and gate `ctx.model()` behind a declared allow-list.

  BREAKING (`@crowi/plugin-api`): `PluginContext.crypto` (and the `PluginCrypto` type) is removed. It exposed the same global `CROWI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`-derived encrypt/decrypt used for core's sensitive Config and every other plugin's `@sensitive` fields, so any installed plugin could decrypt any other plugin's or core's secrets. No first-party plugin used it — the legitimate way to read a plugin's own `@sensitive` config values is unchanged: `ctx.config<T>()` already returns them transparently decrypted.

  `ctx.model(name)` now requires the plugin to declare the model in a new `CrowiPlugin.modelAccess?: string[]` field (same shape as `requires`). Calling `ctx.model()` for an undeclared model throws `Plugin '<name>' called model('<requested>') but did not declare it in 'modelAccess'.` A model listed in `modelAccess` still gets full (unrestricted) read/write access — there is no read-only mode yet. `PluginManager.activate()` validates every declared model name against the registered core models at boot and fails loudly (isolating just that plugin, same as a bad `configSchema`) on an unknown name.

  `GET /admin/plugins` now includes each plugin's declared `modelAccess` in `PluginInfo`, so an admin can audit which plugins touch which core collections.

  The four first-party plugins that call `ctx.model()` (`@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch`, `@crowi/plugin-search-mongo`, `@crowi/plugin-search-opensearch`, `@crowi/plugin-slack`) now declare their actual (read-only) usage: `['Page', 'Bookmark', 'User']` for the ES/OpenSearch drivers, `['Page', 'Revision']` for the Mongo driver, `['Page']` for Slack.

- fa5023f: `GRANT_RESTRICTED` ("Anyone with the link") pages now actually work like a link-share invite. Opening a restricted page's id URL (`/<page._id>`, and the revived legacy `/_r/<page._id>` short link) via `IdRedirector` adds the visitor to the page's `grantedUsers` on first visit, so a follow-up direct visit to the page's real path — or from the list/search — no longer 404s. Previously `GRANT_RESTRICTED` behaved like `GRANT_SPECIFIED` for anyone who hadn't already been added, silently breaking the promise made by the link-share popover. A permanent banner now appears at the top of a `GRANT_RESTRICTED` page (hidden for wip/deprecated/draft/stale-revision views, where the link wouldn't actually be claimable) that honestly states sharing the URL below invites the recipient as an editor, with a copy-to-clipboard control and no dismiss option.

  The grant-on-first-access write is confined to a new `POST /pages/link-access` endpoint called only by `IdRedirector`: it is web-session only (OAuth/PAT tokens are rejected before the per-user rate limiter counts them), rate-limited at 30 req/min/user, and atomic (a concurrent grant change or soft-delete can never be raced into an invite). `GET /pages?page_id=` and every other by-id caller (`/_edit`, `/_attachments`, comment/bookmark/watch helpers) are unchanged — visiting those does not grant access.

  Also fixes a search-index visibility gap surfaced while implementing this: search results could include stale hits for soft-deleted / redirect-stub pages, and the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch drivers now exclude `wip` / `deprecated` pages from the index (matching list visibility) instead of leaving them as permanent dead hits.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- ff63cd1: Declare an explicit `zod` peer dependency range (`^4`) instead of `catalog:`. pnpm does not resolve the `catalog:` protocol inside `peerDependencies` during a workspace/source install, so building Crowi from source emitted a spurious `unmet peer zod@catalog:` warning for every plugin. Published packages were already correct (pnpm rewrites `catalog:` to a concrete range on publish), so npm consumers were unaffected — this only silences the noisy source/Docker-build install. Declaring `^4` also more honestly states that the plugins are compatible with any zod 4.x the host application provides.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- 72dd9c3: Added a new plugin `@crowi/plugin-search-opensearch` for using OpenSearch as the search backend. Adding the plugin name to `plugins[]` in `crowi.config.json` and setting `search.driver: 'opensearch'` lets you use an OpenSearch cluster as the search backend via `@opensearch-project/opensearch`. Behaviour matches `@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch`: hot-reload via state-ref + snapshot, atomic rebuild using a `<indexName>-current` alias, and the three `default` / `kuromoji` / `sudachi` analyzers. AWS SigV4 auth is not supported (Basic Auth-based url only). Because analysis-kuromoji is shipped as a separate distribution on OpenSearch, operators must install it separately with `bin/opensearch-plugin install analysis-kuromoji` (see the README).

  Also removed `@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch`'s `onInstall` (auto-migration from the `ELASTICSEARCH_URI` / `BONSAI_URL` env vars to the plugin config namespace `url`), unifying both plugins' configuration path onto the single admin UI. Since Crowi 2.0 is in alpha development and not yet in production, there is no backward-compat fallback; operators set the url in the admin UI, then build the initial index with `crowi-admin search rebuild`. Accordingly, the `ELASTICSEARCH_URI` references were removed from `.env.example` / `docker-compose.yml` / related docs.
