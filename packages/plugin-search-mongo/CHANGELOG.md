## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- 8ff0e64: Narrow the plugin SDK's trust boundary: remove `ctx.crypto` and gate `ctx.model()` behind a declared allow-list.

  BREAKING (`@crowi/plugin-api`): `PluginContext.crypto` (and the `PluginCrypto` type) is removed. It exposed the same global `CROWI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`-derived encrypt/decrypt used for core's sensitive Config and every other plugin's `@sensitive` fields, so any installed plugin could decrypt any other plugin's or core's secrets. No first-party plugin used it — the legitimate way to read a plugin's own `@sensitive` config values is unchanged: `ctx.config<T>()` already returns them transparently decrypted.

  `ctx.model(name)` now requires the plugin to declare the model in a new `CrowiPlugin.modelAccess?: string[]` field (same shape as `requires`). Calling `ctx.model()` for an undeclared model throws `Plugin '<name>' called model('<requested>') but did not declare it in 'modelAccess'.` A model listed in `modelAccess` still gets full (unrestricted) read/write access — there is no read-only mode yet. `PluginManager.activate()` validates every declared model name against the registered core models at boot and fails loudly (isolating just that plugin, same as a bad `configSchema`) on an unknown name.

  `GET /admin/plugins` now includes each plugin's declared `modelAccess` in `PluginInfo`, so an admin can audit which plugins touch which core collections.

  The four first-party plugins that call `ctx.model()` (`@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch`, `@crowi/plugin-search-mongo`, `@crowi/plugin-search-opensearch`, `@crowi/plugin-slack`) now declare their actual (read-only) usage: `['Page', 'Bookmark', 'User']` for the ES/OpenSearch drivers, `['Page', 'Revision']` for the Mongo driver, `['Page']` for Slack.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- ff63cd1: Declare an explicit `zod` peer dependency range (`^4`) instead of `catalog:`. pnpm does not resolve the `catalog:` protocol inside `peerDependencies` during a workspace/source install, so building Crowi from source emitted a spurious `unmet peer zod@catalog:` warning for every plugin. Published packages were already correct (pnpm rewrites `catalog:` to a concrete range on publish), so npm consumers were unaffected — this only silences the noisy source/Docker-build install. Declaring `^4` also more honestly states that the plugins are compatible with any zod 4.x the host application provides.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- f56fd9b: Added a new plugin `@crowi/plugin-search-mongo`, an infra-free search backend that needs nothing but MongoDB. Adding the plugin name to `plugins[]` in `crowi.config.json` and setting `search.driver: 'mongo'` makes search run as a live MongoDB `$regex` query over page path / title / body, so small-to-mid deployments can use full-text-ish search without standing up Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.

  The driver is grant-aware (anonymous viewers see public pages only; non-admin viewers see public pages plus their own and pages granted to them; admins see everything; draft / deleted / redirect pages are always excluded), and supports `pageType` (portal / public / user), `pathPrefix` filtering and paging (`page` / `limit`, capped at 200). Because it queries live data there is no index to build or maintain: `index()` / `remove()` are no-ops. Body matches are resolved against the current revision in a bulk pass with a candidate cap to keep collection scans bounded; this is positioned for small-to-mid wikis, while large deployments should keep using the Elasticsearch / OpenSearch plugins.
