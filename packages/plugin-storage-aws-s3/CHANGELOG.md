## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- d611836: Plugin SDK: add a hot-reload `StateCell<T>` primitive, exposed as `ctx.state<T>(initial)` on `PluginContext`. It gives `reconfigure`-implementing driver plugins (storage / search / mail sending) a structured way to hold a swappable resource (an SDK client, a connection pool) instead of hand-rolling module-scope mutable state: `get()`/`withValue()` read the current value, and `set(next, { dispose })` swaps in a new one — `dispose(prev)` only runs once every `withValue()` call in flight against the previous value has settled, so a resource still in use is never torn down under a caller. For the same plugin, every `PluginContext` instance (the activation-time `ctx` and every later `reconfigure(ctx)`) shares the same cell.

  `@crowi/plugin-storage-aws-s3`, `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp`, and `@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch` are migrated onto this primitive. Each now explicitly disposes the resource `reconfigure` replaces — `S3Client.destroy()`, `Transporter.close()`, and the Elasticsearch `Client.close()` respectively — fixing a connection leak on every hot-reload. The Elasticsearch driver's client close is also no longer fire-and-forget the instant `reconfigure` returns: it now waits for any in-flight search/index/remove/rebuild call still using the old client to finish first.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- ff63cd1: Declare an explicit `zod` peer dependency range (`^4`) instead of `catalog:`. pnpm does not resolve the `catalog:` protocol inside `peerDependencies` during a workspace/source install, so building Crowi from source emitted a spurious `unmet peer zod@catalog:` warning for every plugin. Published packages were already correct (pnpm rewrites `catalog:` to a concrete range on publish), so npm consumers were unaffected — this only silences the noisy source/Docker-build install. Declaring `^4` also more honestly states that the plugins are compatible with any zod 4.x the host application provides.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- a52d03f: Initial publish preparation: monorepo restructure complete (RFC-0002 →
  feature-monorepo-packages-restructure). All packages now use
  workspace: protocol internally, peerDependencies for plugin boundaries,
  shared @crowi/tsconfig presets, and a publish-ready layout under
  packages/\*.
