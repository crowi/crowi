# @crowi/plugin-api

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- ff63cd1: Declare an explicit `zod` peer dependency range (`^4`) instead of `catalog:`. pnpm does not resolve the `catalog:` protocol inside `peerDependencies` during a workspace/source install, so building Crowi from source emitted a spurious `unmet peer zod@catalog:` warning for every plugin. Published packages were already correct (pnpm rewrites `catalog:` to a concrete range on publish), so npm consumers were unaffected — this only silences the noisy source/Docker-build install. Declaring `^4` also more honestly states that the plugins are compatible with any zod 4.x the host application provides.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- a52d03f: Initial publish preparation: monorepo restructure complete (RFC-0002 →
  feature-monorepo-packages-restructure). All packages now use
  workspace: protocol internally, peerDependencies for plugin boundaries,
  shared @crowi/tsconfig presets, and a publish-ready layout under
  packages/\*.
- 966d133: Make email delivery plugin-based.

  Email sending is now a pluggable transport. The core assembles every
  message (from / subject / rendered body) so it is identical regardless of
  which sender is active, and a mail sender plugin only delivers the
  finished message. The active sender is selected by
  `crowi.config.json:mail.driver` (default `smtp`), mirroring the storage
  and search single-active-driver model.

  - New `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp` (default-on) delivers over SMTP via
    nodemailer.
  - New `@crowi/plugin-mail-resend` and `@crowi/plugin-mail-aws-ses`
    (depends on `@crowi/plugin-aws`) official senders.
  - New `registerMailSender` plugin hook + `MailSender` / `EmailMessage`
    contract in `@crowi/plugin-api`.
  - `/admin/mail` now owns only the sender-independent `from` address, shows
    the active sender, and sends a test mail through it; each sender's
    credentials are configured under `/admin/plugins`.

  BREAKING: the legacy `mail:smtp*` / `mail:aws:*` Config keys and the SMTP
  / SES fields of the `admin.mail` API are removed. SMTP credentials live in
  the `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp` plugin config namespace instead.

- 7f77407: Plugins can now localize their admin config-form field labels and descriptions.
  A plugin declares a `configI18n` catalog (`locale → field → { label, description }`)
  and the admin API overlays the entry matching the requesting admin's locale on
  top of the schema-derived field; the Zod `.describe()` text remains the default
  when a translation is missing. The `GET /admin/plugins/config` endpoint accepts
  an optional `locale` query parameter, and `PluginField` gained an optional
  `label`. The PlantUML renderer ships Japanese translations for its server URL
  and image format fields as the first consumer.
