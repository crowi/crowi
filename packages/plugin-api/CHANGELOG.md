# @crowi/plugin-api

## 1.0.0-alpha.7

### Minor Changes

- 9a06104: Add sign-in with Google, as a plugin (RFC-0014). Enable `@crowi/plugin-google` in your runner project, paste a Client ID and secret into the admin plugin screen, and a "Sign in with Google" button appears on the sign-in page without a restart. A first-time federated sign-in picks a username before an account is created, and then follows the instance's registration mode — active immediately when registration is Open, queued for administrator approval when Restricted, refused when Closed. Signed-in users can connect and disconnect providers from Settings, and an unlink is refused when it would leave the account with no way to sign back in. Google gets no special treatment in core: the whole flow (provider list / start / callback / handoff, signed state cookies, PKCE, OIDC verification) is generic, backed by a new auth-driver plugin SDK and a `UserIdentity` linking model, so any other OIDC provider can be added the same way. An email address is honoured only when the provider asserts it is verified, and one that matches an existing local account is never auto-linked — that sign-in is refused, and linking has to be done deliberately from Settings. Requires `AUTH_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` (or `CLIENT_URL`) to be set; see the "Signing in with an external account" operations guide for setup.

## 1.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- c5f243a: Admins now see a non-blocking warning banner (on every wiki page and in `/admin/plugins`) when the currently selected storage or search driver is missing configuration it needs to actually work — such as the S3 bucket name, or the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster URL — so misconfiguration is caught before it causes an upload or search failure instead of only surfacing as a 500 later.

  - New `CrowiPlugin.readiness` SDK declaration lets a plugin state which of its own config fields must be set once a specific driver is selected; `@crowi/plugin-storage-aws-s3` (`bucket`), `@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch`, and `@crowi/plugin-search-opensearch` (`url`) declare it.
  - New admin-only `GET /admin/plugins/readiness` endpoint reports only the plugin name, its admin placement, and the unset field names — never the actual config value, URL, or any secret.
  - The wiki header and the `/admin/plugins` list link straight to the affected plugin's config screen; saving the missing field clears the warning on the next refetch.
  - Non-admins never see the banner and never trigger the readiness request.

### Patch Changes

- 8b42663: Security dependency updates. `hono` moves to `4.13.0` (the declared floor is now `^4.12.34`, the first release without GHSA-advisory-affected versions) — for `@crowi/plugin-api` this also raises its `hono` peer range, so a plugin pinning an older 4.12.x will need to move up. Transitively, `undici` 7.x reaches `7.29.0` and `ip-address` reaches `10.4.0`, both within their existing parents' ranges. No `pnpm.overrides` entries were needed for any of these.

## 1.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- 7a7394f: Make `renderedAst` a client-agnostic typed contract (RFC-0023). Renderer producers (shiki, KaTeX, Mermaid, PlantUML, link cards, placeholders) now stamp typed sidecar data onto the byte-identical `html` nodes they already emit, and clients that declare `X-Crowi-Ast-Version: 1` receive a validated `{astVersion, root}` envelope in which those nodes are projected into typed nodes (`code` with themed tokens, `math`/`inlineMath` with TeX source, `crowiDiagram` with intrinsic dimensions, `crowiLinkCard`, `crowiPlaceholder`) — the foundation for native (non-HTML) rendering such as the iOS app. Requests without the header — including the web, permanently — keep receiving the stored bare mdast Root verbatim, so existing clients and open tabs are unaffected. Responses now also carry `renderedAstArtifactKey`, which fixes a web bug where a pending diagram that finished rendering (or a freshness-mismatch recompute) was not re-drawn on refetch because the render memo only keyed on the revision id. Operators: this release bumps the renderer pipeline to 1.0.0 and removes the missing-version freshness special case — run the new `crowi-admin rebuild rendered-ast` (real writes) immediately after deploying, and use `--dry-run` only before that; see the admin guide's "rebuild rendered-ast" section for the rollout and completion procedure.
- 7688188: `@crowi/plugin-api` now re-exports `sanitizeSvg` and `extractSvgDimensions`, so a plugin that needs SVG sanitization gets it from the SDK rather than from a package of its own. This also fixes a release-blocking defect: `@crowi/api` had picked up a runtime dependency on the private, never-published `@crowi/svg-sanitize`, which would have published an `@crowi/api` whose declared dependency does not exist on npm — core builds with `tsc` and cannot inline a workspace package itself, so it now takes the sanitizer from the SDK too. The SDK is the single place the private package is inlined, which also means a sanitizer change no longer obliges re-publishing every renderer plugin. `@xmldom/xmldom` becomes a declared dependency of `@crowi/plugin-api` (it is deliberately not inlined, so operators can still address a CVE in it through their own lockfile).

## 1.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- df1ce77: Give renderer plugins a first-class way to show a working fallback UI on render failure, and make the plugin-render cache keep the last-good output on screen through a transient failure.

  `@crowi/plugin-api`'s `RenderResult` gains an optional `errorHtml` field, paired with `error`: when set, `@crowi/api` shows `errorHtml` instead of the generic link-less placeholder, and a new `RenderError.code: 'blocked'` covers policy-level permanent rejections (SSRF block, disallowed scheme, disallowed content-type) with the same 1h TTL as `not_found`. `@crowi/api`'s plugin-render cache also adds a stale-if-error policy: when a previously-successful embed or code-block render's background/blocking revalidation fails, the last-good output stays on screen (retried at the failure's own TTL cadence) for up to 24h before degrading to `errorHtml` or the placeholder — this applies uniformly to every renderer plugin, not just link cards, so e.g. a PlantUML diagram no longer drops to a placeholder while the PlantUML server briefly restarts.

  Crowi's `@[card](url)` link-card embed (originally shipped as the separate `@crowi/plugin-renderer-link-card` plugin, since folded directly into `@crowi/api` core — see the emoji/link-card core-absorption changeset) migrates its failure path onto this real contract instead of disguising every OGP-fetch failure as a successful render with a plugin-local shortened TTL: per-failure-class TTL (persistent 1h for blocked/not-found sources, transient 5min for network/timeout, `Retry-After`-aware rate-limit handling) is now expressed through the shared `error` + `errorHtml` mechanism, so admin telemetry sees the real failure instead of a fake success. The `errorHtml` a link-card render shows today is the unified fallback card described in the emoji/link-card core-absorption changeset — a plain link to the original URL with no error-red styling, not a dedicated error card.

- 05648c0: Bound the link-card OGP-fetch semaphore's wait queue to close a DoS where a page embedding `@[card]` links to many unique, slow/unresponsive hosts could pile up an unbounded number of unresolved fetches (crowi-review CROWI-REVIEW-002, high severity).

  The shared fetch semaphore (`FETCH_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT = 5`, unchanged) now caps its wait queue at a fixed length and gives queued requests a wait deadline distinct from the post-acquisition fetch timeout. A request that arrives once the queue is already full is rejected synchronously with a new `busy` outcome, never queuing another unresolved Promise; a request that was accepted into the queue but times out before a slot opens up is rejected the same way once its deadline elapses. `@crowi/plugin-api`'s `RenderError.code` union gains `'busy'`, mapped to the same unified link-card fallback card every other OGP-fetch failure uses (no new UI variant) and cached with a short transient TTL so a subsequent render retries once the queue drains.

- d680c0c: Add server-side Mermaid diagram rendering (RFC-0002 Phase 6.1).

  New `@crowi/plugin-renderer-mermaid` plugin: ` ```mermaid ` fenced code blocks are rendered entirely server-side in an isolated, network-denied child process (no client-side Mermaid JS ever ships to the browser) and embedded as a sanitized, base64-encoded SVG `<img>`. Supports flowchart, sequence, class, state, ER, journey, pie, and git-graph diagrams, with a shared, independently-tested DOM-based SVG sanitizer (new, private `@crowi/svg-sanitize` package) that also replaces `@crowi/plugin-renderer-plantuml`'s previous regex-only sanitizer. No operator configuration is required, and existing pages keep rendering their `mermaid` fences as plain code blocks until the author explicitly re-saves them.

  The editor's live preview now renders Mermaid diagrams as you type, not just after saving: a new `previewPolicy` opt-in on `CodeBlockRenderer` lets a renderer participate in non-persistent preview rendering (page-less, no cache writes), gated by the same per-user admission-control concurrency limits and priority scheduling used for saved-page rendering, plus a per-user rate limit on the preview endpoint and proper request cancellation when a newer keystroke supersedes an in-flight preview.

  The page-view diagram wrapper (click-to-enlarge, cap-to-width, dark-mode-neutral surface) is generalized from PlantUML-only to any diagram renderer, so Mermaid diagrams get the same affordance PlantUML diagrams already had.

- a32204f: Absorb the emoji shortcode transform and the `@[card](url)` link-card embed directly into `@crowi/api` core — both are now always-on Markdown features and no longer need to be installed as separate renderer plugins. The `@crowi/plugin-renderer-emoji` and `@crowi/plugin-renderer-link-card` packages have been removed from the workspace entirely; they are no longer published.

  Link-card OGP fetching is controlled by a new admin Security setting, "Allow link cards for external URLs" (default ON, matching the previous plugin-installed behaviour and GitHub/Slack/Notion-style link unfurling). Disabling it stops all new outbound OGP requests immediately — including bypassing the render cache entirely, so a card fetched while enabled is never served stale after a disable, and a disable never leaves a cached fallback behind after a re-enable — and every render that cannot show a real preview (a disabled toggle, a fetch failure, a blocked/air-gapped host) now shows the exact same non-error-styled fallback card (a plain link to the original URL) instead of the old dedicated error-card variant.

  Operators upgrading with `@crowi/plugin-renderer-emoji` or `@crowi/plugin-renderer-link-card` still listed in `crowi.config.json` (or their npm packages still listed as a runner dependency) see a one-time boot warning instead of a hard failure — remove the two entries (and the matching `dependencies`) once convenient; they no longer do anything, and the packages no longer exist to install.

  `@crowi/plugin-api`'s `EmbedRenderer` gains an optional `shouldBypassCache(input)` hook — a renderer whose output depends on a runtime policy toggle (like link-card's) can use it to skip the render cache entirely for a given dispatch instead of only checking the toggle inside `render()`, which would otherwise let a stale cache hit serve pre-toggle output.

### Patch Changes

- b0e2c76: Bump dependencies to clear Dependabot security advisories (alerts #622/#623/#626-#637).

  - `sharp` 0.34.5 → 0.35.3, direct in `@crowi/api` (GHSA sharp <0.35.0). Also
    overridden repo-wide (`sharp@<0.35.3` → `0.35.3`) since Next.js pins an
    optional `sharp: ^0.34.5` dependency of its own that a Next.js version bump
    can't escape.
  - `@hono/node-server` 2.0.3 → 2.0.11, direct in `@crowi/api` (GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9
    path traversal / GHSA-9mqv-5hh9-4cgg WS handshake DoS). Also overridden
    (`@hono/node-server@<2.0.11` → `2.0.11`) for the transitive 1.19.14
    resolution pulled in by `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`'s own `dependencies` —
    verified crowi never imports the SDK module that requires it
    (`@hono/mcp`'s `StreamableHTTPTransport` mounts into our own existing Hono
    app/server instead), so this resolution was unreachable dead code, but the
    override closes the alert cleanly regardless.
  - `hono` bumped to 4.12.31 (within the existing `^4.12.25` range) across
    `@crowi/api` / `@crowi/api-contract` / `@crowi/plugin-api` / `@crowi/plugin-slack`.
  - `js-yaml` overridden to `3.15.0` / `4.3.0` per major line
    (`js-yaml@>=3.0.0 <3.15.0` / `js-yaml@>=4.0.0 <4.3.0`) — covers every
    transitive consumer (jest/istanbul's 3.x chain, eslint 8/9, changesets,
    the mjml/htmlnano chain, fumadocs, `@redocly/openapi-core`) plus
    `@crowi/api-contract`'s own direct `js-yaml` dependency, bumped to `^4.3.0`.
  - `svgo` and `fast-uri` overridden to `4.0.2` / `3.1.4` — their parents
    (`htmlnano`, `ajv`) already declare wide-enough ranges to permit the
    patched versions but pnpm won't re-resolve a pure-transitive package
    within an already-satisfied range without a forcing mechanism.

  The sharp 0.35 bump changed its TypeScript declarations from the old
  namespace-merged `sharp.Sharp`/`sharp.Metadata`/`sharp.OutputInfo` pattern to
  named exports; `image-display-derivative.ts` updated its type imports
  accordingly (no behavior change). It also surfaced a latent bug in this
  package's own test fixture (an ancillary PNG chunk type `padA` with a
  lowercase reserved-bit byte, which is not PNG-spec-conformant — sharp 0.34's
  bundled `spng` PNG decoder tolerated it, 0.35's `libpng`-backed decoder
  correctly rejects it); the fixture was corrected to `paDA`, no production
  code changed.

## 1.0.0-alpha.3

### Major Changes

- 336eec1: Close two residual paths from the plugin SDK's trust boundary to core/other-plugin secrets, making the "a plugin cannot reach another plugin's or core's secrets through PluginContext" claim true rather than aspirational.

  BREAKING (`@crowi/plugin-api`): credential-vault core models (`Config`, `PersonalAccessToken`, `OAuthClient`, `OAuthAuthorizationCode`, `OAuthDeviceCode`, `OAuthRefreshToken`, `Share`, `ShareAccess`) can no longer be listed in `CrowiPlugin.modelAccess` at all — declaring one now fails boot with a descriptive error (`PluginManager.activate()`'s `assertValidModelAccess()`), and `ctx.model()` also refuses to return one at call time as defense-in-depth. Previously any plugin could declare `modelAccess: ['Config']` and read every core/plugin `@sensitive` value in decrypted form, or read/write `PersonalAccessToken` / OAuth token rows directly — there was no legitimate plugin use case for this, so no first-party plugin is affected.

  BREAKING (`@crowi/plugin-api`): `ctx.dependencyConfig(name)` now also requires the target plugin to opt in with a new `CrowiPlugin.exposesConfigToDependents?: boolean` field. Previously, listing a dependency in `requires` was sufficient to read its decrypted config (`@sensitive` fields included) — a plugin could self-declare `requires: ['@crowi/plugin-aws']` and read AWS credentials without `@crowi/plugin-aws`'s consent. `@crowi/plugin-aws` now declares `exposesConfigToDependents: true` (its whole purpose is sharing credentials with `@crowi/plugin-storage-aws-s3` / `@crowi/plugin-mail-aws-ses`), so that existing dependency chain keeps working unchanged; any other plugin that depended on this implicit access would need to add the flag.

  The `PluginContext` trust-boundary doc (`packages/plugin-api/src/context.ts`), `CrowiPlugin`'s TSDoc, and the plugins developing guide (ja/en) are updated to state the now-true claims, plus the one remaining honest caveat: `modelAccess: ['User']` still returns the raw document (password hash included) — field projection is deferred to a post-2.0 repository/HTTP layer separation.

- 8ff0e64: Narrow the plugin SDK's trust boundary: remove `ctx.crypto` and gate `ctx.model()` behind a declared allow-list.

  BREAKING (`@crowi/plugin-api`): `PluginContext.crypto` (and the `PluginCrypto` type) is removed. It exposed the same global `CROWI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`-derived encrypt/decrypt used for core's sensitive Config and every other plugin's `@sensitive` fields, so any installed plugin could decrypt any other plugin's or core's secrets. No first-party plugin used it — the legitimate way to read a plugin's own `@sensitive` config values is unchanged: `ctx.config<T>()` already returns them transparently decrypted.

  `ctx.model(name)` now requires the plugin to declare the model in a new `CrowiPlugin.modelAccess?: string[]` field (same shape as `requires`). Calling `ctx.model()` for an undeclared model throws `Plugin '<name>' called model('<requested>') but did not declare it in 'modelAccess'.` A model listed in `modelAccess` still gets full (unrestricted) read/write access — there is no read-only mode yet. `PluginManager.activate()` validates every declared model name against the registered core models at boot and fails loudly (isolating just that plugin, same as a bad `configSchema`) on an unknown name.

  `GET /admin/plugins` now includes each plugin's declared `modelAccess` in `PluginInfo`, so an admin can audit which plugins touch which core collections.

  The four first-party plugins that call `ctx.model()` (`@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch`, `@crowi/plugin-search-mongo`, `@crowi/plugin-search-opensearch`, `@crowi/plugin-slack`) now declare their actual (read-only) usage: `['Page', 'Bookmark', 'User']` for the ES/OpenSearch drivers, `['Page', 'Revision']` for the Mongo driver, `['Page']` for Slack.

### Minor Changes

- b20ff59: Plugin SDK: `PluginRouteOptions.public?: boolean` is replaced by `auth?: 'public' | 'user' | 'admin'` (default `'user'`). `makePluginRouterScope` now installs `createJwtAdminRequired` — the same middleware every core `/admin/*` handler uses — for `auth: 'admin'` routes, so plugins finally have a real admin-only tier instead of only "no auth" / "any authenticated user".

  BREAKING (pre-1.0 SDK): plugins passing `{ public: true }` must switch to `{ auth: 'public' }`; the `public` field no longer exists on `PluginRouteOptions`.

  Fixes a real gap in `@crowi/plugin-slack`: its `POST /manifest` `@action` target (which returns the Slack App manifest, including the wiki's base URL and name) was documented as admin-only but was actually reachable by any authenticated non-admin user. It is now mounted with `auth: 'admin'` and returns `403 ADMIN_REQUIRED` for non-admin users. The Events API webhook keeps `auth: 'public'` (Slack's own request-signature check is its authentication).

  Also narrows `@action` annotation parsing (`schema-markers.ts`) to the two verbs a plugin route can actually be mounted on (`GET` / `POST` — `PluginRouteMethod`), so a plugin declaring `@action "..." PUT ...` / `DELETE` no longer produces a silently-dead admin-form button: `getActionAnnotation` still returns `null` for it, and `PluginManager` now logs a boot-time warning identifying the offending plugin and config field.

- d611836: Plugin SDK: add a hot-reload `StateCell<T>` primitive, exposed as `ctx.state<T>(initial)` on `PluginContext`. It gives `reconfigure`-implementing driver plugins (storage / search / mail sending) a structured way to hold a swappable resource (an SDK client, a connection pool) instead of hand-rolling module-scope mutable state: `get()`/`withValue()` read the current value, and `set(next, { dispose })` swaps in a new one — `dispose(prev)` only runs once every `withValue()` call in flight against the previous value has settled, so a resource still in use is never torn down under a caller. For the same plugin, every `PluginContext` instance (the activation-time `ctx` and every later `reconfigure(ctx)`) shares the same cell.

  `@crowi/plugin-storage-aws-s3`, `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp`, and `@crowi/plugin-search-elasticsearch` are migrated onto this primitive. Each now explicitly disposes the resource `reconfigure` replaces — `S3Client.destroy()`, `Transporter.close()`, and the Elasticsearch `Client.close()` respectively — fixing a connection leak on every hot-reload. The Elasticsearch driver's client close is also no longer fire-and-forget the instant `reconfigure` returns: it now waits for any in-flight search/index/remove/rebuild call still using the old client to finish first.

### Patch Changes

- 5e857f6: Fail plugin boot loudly when a `configSchema` is built from the wrong zod entry point, instead of silently losing `@sensitive` detection and writing secrets to storage as plaintext.

  `@crowi/plugin-api`'s `peerDependencies: { zod: "^4" }` only says which npm package to install; it does not say which entry point to import from, and every config-schema introspection helper (`@sensitive`/`@action` marker detection, the admin form field serializer, `listSensitiveKeys()`) depends on the internal shape of the `zod/v3` compat subpath the v4 package ships. A `configSchema` built from the top-level `zod` (v4) API has a different internal shape that all of that introspection silently fails to walk. `PluginManager.bootstrap()` now validates every loaded plugin's `configSchema` right after resolving plugin order, before it calls `listSensitiveKeys()` (which is itself zod/v3-dependent), and throws a descriptive error naming the offending plugin when it wasn't built from `zod/v3`; `activate()` keeps its own equivalent per-plugin check for direct/private-call coverage. `schema-serializer.ts`'s kind detection also switched from `instanceof z.ZodXxx` to `_def.typeName` string comparisons, which is more robust against duplicate `zod/v3` module copies and gives the same defense in depth. `@crowi/plugin-api` gains a README (previously missing despite `package.json`'s `files` already listing it) documenting this, plus a `configSchema` TSDoc note.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- 66f1de2: Plugin SDK: add `ctx.appInfo()` to `PluginContext`. It exposes core application info a plugin may need to brand or address outbound integrations — `title` (the configured wiki name, core `app:title`, trimmed and defaulted to `Crowi`) and `baseUrl` (the wiki's public origin, core `CLIENT_URL` / `getBaseUrl()`, empty string when unset). Both fields are non-null, so plugins read them instead of `process.env` directly without writing their own fallbacks; read live at call time, so they reflect admin edits made after boot.
- e9aad03: Plugin SDK: `registerRoutes(scope, ctx)` now mounts plugin-contributed HTTP
  routes on Hono at `/api/v2/plugins/<name>/<path>`. The previous no-op stub is
  replaced by a real surface: `scope.route(method, path, handler, opts?)` takes a
  plain Hono `Context` handler, with a `public` flag (bypass Crowi auth for
  self-authenticating webhooks) and a guaranteed raw-body access (no body-consuming
  validator runs ahead of the handler, so `c.req.text()` / `c.req.raw` yield the
  exact bytes the client sent) for HMAC signature verification. The `<name>` path
  segment isolates each plugin from core endpoints and from other plugins.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- ff63cd1: Declare an explicit `zod` peer dependency range (`^4`) instead of `catalog:`. pnpm does not resolve the `catalog:` protocol inside `peerDependencies` during a workspace/source install, so building Crowi from source emitted a spurious `unmet peer zod@catalog:` warning for every plugin. Published packages were already correct (pnpm rewrites `catalog:` to a concrete range on publish), so npm consumers were unaffected — this only silences the noisy source/Docker-build install. Declaring `^4` also more honestly states that the plugins are compatible with any zod 4.x the host application provides.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- a52d03f: Initial publish preparation: monorepo restructure complete (RFC-0002 →
  feature-monorepo-packages-restructure). All packages now use
  workspace: protocol internally, peerDependencies for plugin boundaries,
  shared @crowi/tsconfig presets, and a publish-ready layout under
  packages/\*.
- 966d133: Make email delivery plugin-based.

  Email sending is now a pluggable transport. The core assembles every
  message (from / subject / rendered body) so it is identical regardless of
  which sender is active, and a mail sender plugin only delivers the
  finished message. The active sender is selected by
  `crowi.config.json:mail.driver` (default `smtp`), mirroring the storage
  and search single-active-driver model.

  - New `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp` (default-on) delivers over SMTP via
    nodemailer.
  - New `@crowi/plugin-mail-resend` and `@crowi/plugin-mail-aws-ses`
    (depends on `@crowi/plugin-aws`) official senders.
  - New `registerMailSender` plugin hook + `MailSender` / `EmailMessage`
    contract in `@crowi/plugin-api`.
  - `/admin/mail` now owns only the sender-independent `from` address, shows
    the active sender, and sends a test mail through it; each sender's
    credentials are configured under `/admin/plugins`.

  BREAKING: the legacy `mail:smtp*` / `mail:aws:*` Config keys and the SMTP
  / SES fields of the `admin.mail` API are removed. SMTP credentials live in
  the `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp` plugin config namespace instead.

- 7f77407: Plugins can now localize their admin config-form field labels and descriptions.
  A plugin declares a `configI18n` catalog (`locale → field → { label, description }`)
  and the admin API overlays the entry matching the requesting admin's locale on
  top of the schema-derived field; the Zod `.describe()` text remains the default
  when a translation is missing. The `GET /admin/plugins/config` endpoint accepts
  an optional `locale` query parameter, and `PluginField` gained an optional
  `label`. The PlantUML renderer ships Japanese translations for its server URL
  and image format fields as the first consumer.
