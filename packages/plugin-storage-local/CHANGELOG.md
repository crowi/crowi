# @crowi/plugin-storage-local

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- c810729: Saving local storage, AWS S3, or Elasticsearch configuration from `/admin/plugins` now runs a non-blocking connectivity/permission check right after the existing save and hot-reload finish. Local and S3 do a real `put` / `get` / `delete` round trip under a reserved key namespace, entirely separate from uploaded attachments; Elasticsearch calls the cluster's `info` API once. The admin UI shows the outcome next to the existing save toast — "saved, but verification failed" with one of a small set of fixed reasons (unreachable, authentication failed, not found, write denied, unknown) — without ever undoing the save; a failed check is informational only.

  The check always reflects just the api instance that answered the save request, never a cluster-wide result, and every form control (including the linked-identities confirmation dialog) is disabled while a save is in flight so edits can't race the response.

  Plugin authors can opt into the same mechanism via the new optional `CrowiPlugin.verifyConfig` hook in `@crowi/plugin-api`, documented in that package's README.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- ff63cd1: Declare an explicit `zod` peer dependency range (`^4`) instead of `catalog:`. pnpm does not resolve the `catalog:` protocol inside `peerDependencies` during a workspace/source install, so building Crowi from source emitted a spurious `unmet peer zod@catalog:` warning for every plugin. Published packages were already correct (pnpm rewrites `catalog:` to a concrete range on publish), so npm consumers were unaffected — this only silences the noisy source/Docker-build install. Declaring `^4` also more honestly states that the plugins are compatible with any zod 4.x the host application provides.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- 3eb9504: Use English admin sidebar labels for the local-storage and Crowi-v1 renderer
  plugins. Their `adminPlacement.label` was hardcoded in Japanese ("ローカルストレージ"
  / "Crowi v1 互換レンダラー") and showed even in the English admin UI; the sidebar
  label has no per-locale mechanism, so this aligns them with every other plugin
  (AWS S3, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, …) which already use neutral English labels.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- a52d03f: Initial publish preparation: monorepo restructure complete (RFC-0002 →
  feature-monorepo-packages-restructure). All packages now use
  workspace: protocol internally, peerDependencies for plugin boundaries,
  shared @crowi/tsconfig presets, and a publish-ready layout under
  packages/\*.
