# @crowi/api-contract

## 2.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- ea2b7db: Remove the external-share admin feature (admin/share endpoints, app:externalShare config, UI surface). The feature will return as a plugin.

  This is a breaking change: the `GET`/`PUT /api/v2/admin/share` endpoints are
  unregistered (now 404), the `app:externalShare` config seed key is removed, and
  the `externalShare` field is dropped from the `/admin/app` response schema. The
  `/admin/share` page and its admin sidebar entry are gone. Page link-sharing
  (LinkSharePopover / `page.share.*`) and the dormant Share / ShareAccess models
  are kept untouched.

- ee935ad: Remove Google/GitHub social-login scaffolding (config seeds, /me googleId/githubId fields, profile + admin coming-soon surfaces). The admin auth toggles disablePasswordAuth/requireThirdPartyAuth are now inert (hidden in the UI and rejected with 400) since third-party sign-in is gone; they will be reactivated when social login returns as a plugin.

### Minor Changes

- 8d8e04d: Surface the confidentiality notice (`app:confidential`) in the app header. The
  public `GET /app/info` response now includes a `confidential` field, and the
  authenticated web shell renders the operator-set text as an always-on marker:
  a compact muted-amber label in the header's right cluster on desktop (which
  yields while the global search box is focused so the search can expand), and a
  thin centered line directly under the header on mobile where the right cluster
  has no room. The notice is hidden entirely when unset. This makes screenshots
  and printouts visibly carry the confidentiality marker, satisfying corporate
  IT requirements.
- c7443c4: Add a "Create page" modal to the header. Previously the only way to make a
  new page was to navigate to an unknown path by hand. The modal lets you
  build a `/`-rooted path with Tab-cycle completion against existing pages:
  Tab/Shift+Tab cycle through prefix-matching paths (shallowest first) and
  write the choice straight into the input, so you can keep typing to reach
  the path you want. Paths that already exist are flagged and can't be
  re-created; submitting opens the create-mode editor for the new path.

  Backed by a new `anchor=prefix` mode on `GET /pages/autocomplete` so the
  completion list only contains true prefixes of what the user has typed.

- ce294dd: Rebuilt the Markdown editor on CodeMirror 6 and brought back the two-column live preview. The `/_edit` page now uses a dedicated viewport-width layout — editor on the left, preview on the right (Tabs toggle on narrow widths) — and the preview follows typing with a 250ms debounce. The preview goes through the server-side renderer pipeline (`POST /api/v2/pages/preview`), so it renders via the same mdast → React path as page display, making the editing and saved views look identical.

  `MarkdownEditor` is implemented as a controlled component (`value` / `onChange` / `readonly` / `extraExtensions`). The `extraExtensions` slot is the foundation for injecting the `yCollab` extension in the future realtime collab work (RFC-0003).

- ad0cc9b: Notification updates now reflect in realtime (polling removed, replaced by a WebSocket invalidation signal).

  Removed the polling where `useUnreadCount` hit `GET /notifications/status` every 30 seconds, and added a `/notifications/<userId>` WebSocket channel to the api process. When a server operation such as Notification.create / markAsRead / markAsOpened / markAllAsRead happens, the api instance the affected user is connected to pushes `{"type":"changed"}` via Redis pub/sub (channel: `crowi:notifications:user:<userId>`). On receiving the signal, the web side invalidates the react-query keys under `notificationKeys.all` and refetches the latest value from the existing REST API (i.e. a hybrid that does not push the data itself).

  - New endpoint: `GET /api/v2/notifications/token` (short-lived JWT, issuer=`crowi-notifications`, TTL 60s)
  - New WebSocket: `/notifications/<userId>?token=<jwt>`
  - Redis required: a multi-instance setup needs `REDIS_URL` (the same pub/sub mechanism as presence / collab). Single-instance dev without `REDIS_URL` runs in a degraded mode where the WS connects but invalidation signals don't arrive.
  - Compatibility: the existing REST API is unchanged; the only difference from the UI is that the polling requests disappear.

- 32f5965: Watchers are now notified when a page they watch is updated.

  Saving a new revision of a page body (over HTTP or via realtime collaborative editing) now fans out an `UPDATE` notification to the page's watchers, alongside the existing `COMMENT` / `LIKE` / `MENTION` notifications.

  - The audience is the page's WATCH watchers, minus IGNORE opt-outs, the editor themselves, and inactive users — the same fan-out the comment / like notifications use. Editors are auto-watched on save, so they join the watcher set without notifying themselves.
  - Repeated saves and saves by multiple editors collapse into a single unread notification per recipient, with the actors bundled (rendered as "A and N others updated …").
  - Only body updates that create a new revision notify. Rename / move and other metadata-only changes, and soft-deletes (moving a page to trash), do not.
  - New `NotificationAction` enum value `UPDATE` (api-contract); the web notification list / bell render it with an "updated" action label and navigate to the target page on click.
  - No new endpoint, no schema migration, and existing notification behaviour is unchanged. Mail / Slack notifier plugins pick up the new action automatically via the existing fan-out.

- 548e0c8: Add HTML email templates (MJML) and token-based invitations.

  Transactional emails are now branded, responsive HTML built with MJML
  and rendered by the core MailService (sender plugins still only deliver
  the finished message). Email copy is localized to the recipient's
  language (en / ja), and each message ships both an HTML and a plain-text
  part.

  Invitations are reworked to be secure: instead of emailing a plaintext
  temporary password, an admin invite now sends a signed, expiring
  invite-link. The invitee lands on a public `/invite/accept?token=…`
  page, chooses their own username / name / password, and is signed in on
  acceptance (account flips from invited to active). The invite token uses
  the same JWT scheme as the WebSocket tokens (`WS_TOKEN_SECRET`,
  per-purpose claims).

  Activation (registration email confirmation) and self-service password
  reset ship their MJML templates and localized copy in this release; their
  end-to-end flows land in a follow-up.

  BREAKING: invite emails no longer contain a temporary password — invited
  users set their own credentials via the invite link.

- a52d03f: Initial publish preparation: monorepo restructure complete (RFC-0002 →
  feature-monorepo-packages-restructure). All packages now use
  workspace: protocol internally, peerDependencies for plugin boundaries,
  shared @crowi/tsconfig presets, and a publish-ready layout under
  packages/\*.
- a0f4ada: Two fixes to the visibility and display of the page list (`/...slug.../`, `/`):

  - **Fixed the grant filter on the root / no-path branch**: the old implementation hard-coded `grant: { $in: [1, 2] }`, which (a) dropped the viewer's own GRANT_OWNER / GRANT_SPECIFIED pages, and (b) risked leaking GRANT_RESTRICTED pages to non-members because grantedUsers was not checked. Aligned it to combine the Page model's `visiblePageGrantOr` / `visiblePageStatusOr` with `$and`, unifying the behaviour with the path-based listings.
  - **Visual identification of draft pages**: added `'draft'` to `PageStatusSchema` (path-based listings already included the viewer's own drafts via RFC-0004, but the status field couldn't be represented in TypeScript without the enum value, so the badge couldn't be shown). Added an amber "Draft" badge to `PageListItem`, so your own drafts are distinguishable at a glance even when sitting next to published pages.

- 966d133: Make email delivery plugin-based.

  Email sending is now a pluggable transport. The core assembles every
  message (from / subject / rendered body) so it is identical regardless of
  which sender is active, and a mail sender plugin only delivers the
  finished message. The active sender is selected by
  `crowi.config.json:mail.driver` (default `smtp`), mirroring the storage
  and search single-active-driver model.

  - New `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp` (default-on) delivers over SMTP via
    nodemailer.
  - New `@crowi/plugin-mail-resend` and `@crowi/plugin-mail-aws-ses`
    (depends on `@crowi/plugin-aws`) official senders.
  - New `registerMailSender` plugin hook + `MailSender` / `EmailMessage`
    contract in `@crowi/plugin-api`.
  - `/admin/mail` now owns only the sender-independent `from` address, shows
    the active sender, and sends a test mail through it; each sender's
    credentials are configured under `/admin/plugins`.

  BREAKING: the legacy `mail:smtp*` / `mail:aws:*` Config keys and the SMTP
  / SES fields of the `admin.mail` API are removed. SMTP credentials live in
  the `@crowi/plugin-mail-smtp` plugin config namespace instead.

- e7296c0: Add more transactional emails on the shared HTML design system.

  - **Test mail** is now the branded HTML template (was plain text), so the
    admin can verify the real look from `/admin/mail`.
  - **Password-changed notification**: a security notice is sent to the
    account when its password is changed (self-service reset or `/me`
    password change).
  - **Admin approval-pending notification**: under restricted registration,
    every active admin is emailed when a user self-registers and awaits
    approval.
  - **Email-change confirmation**: changing your email via `/me` no longer
    applies immediately — a confirmation link is sent to the new address and
    the change is applied only after clicking it (`/confirm-email?token=…`),
    preventing typo / hijack via an unverified address.

  All four reuse the localized (en / ja) MJML templates and the mail-token
  scheme (new `email-change` purpose).

- ec00876: Add an OAuth 2.0 authorization-server foundation so the Crowi CLI / SDK can
  drive the API "as a user" with scoped, revocable tokens, and replace the
  legacy API token (RFC-0010).

  - **Scopes** — per-resource read/write scopes with a canonical `SCOPES`
    catalog and a `scopeSatisfies` implication helper (write→read, umbrella
    read/write) from `@crowi/api-contract`. The unified Bearer middleware is
    scope-aware and a `requireScope(...)` guard is applied per route. Web
    sessions hold all scopes (UI behaviour unchanged); insufficient scope
    returns `403 INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header.
  - **Personal Access Tokens** — issue scoped, optionally-expiring
    `crowi_pat_…` tokens from the settings screen (`GET/POST/DELETE
/me/access-tokens`); only the SHA-256 hash is stored, the plaintext is
    shown once, and token management is web-session only. **Breaking:** the
    legacy `User.apiToken` and `GET/POST /me/apiToken` are removed with no
    compatibility shim — existing API-token users must re-issue a PAT.
  - **Authorization Code + PKCE** — `POST /oauth/authorize` (web-session only)
    - `POST /oauth/token` (authorization code with `S256`, or refresh-token
      rotation with reuse detection that revokes the whole chain) + `POST
/oauth/revoke` (RFC 7009) + a consent screen. A first-party `crowi-cli`
      public client is seeded idempotently at boot.
  - **Device Authorization Grant** (RFC 8628) — `POST /oauth/device/authorize`,
    the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` token grant
    (`authorization_pending` / `slow_down` / `access_denied` / `expired_token`),
    `GET /oauth/device` + `POST /oauth/device/verify`, and a `user_code`
    consent screen for headless clients.
  - **Discovery** — `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414),
    with every public URL built from the trusted `CLIENT_URL` (never the
    request `Host`, which is attacker-controllable).
  - **History** — each revision records its edit channel (`editVia`:
    `web` / `oauth` / `pat`); the page history view shows an "app" chip
    (tooltip: edited via the API with a token) next to the author for OAuth /
    PAT edits, so web vs API edits are distinguishable at a glance.

  Access tokens are short-lived scope-bearing JWTs; refresh tokens,
  authorization / device codes and PATs are stored as SHA-256 hashes only.

- 8f12462: Add sorting to the directory / portal page listing. The list page now offers a sort control with three options — last updated, date created, and name — surfaced as a dropdown in the listing's section header.

  `GET /pages/list` gains optional `sort` (`updatedAt` | `createdAt` | `path`) and `order` (`asc` | `desc`) query parameters, defaulting to `updatedAt` descending so existing callers are unaffected. Sorting applies to the path and root listings; the per-user "created pages" listing keeps its own newest-authored-first order.

- 637f0c9: Add a left rail mirroring the right-rail table of contents (same width,
  sticky offset, and breakpoint). Its shared top section — Top / My page /
  Members / Notifications, plus an Admin shortcut for administrators — shows
  on every page so it no longer disappears on non-wiki routes; full-bleed
  routes (editor / history) opt out, and the member directory and the
  `/me`, `/trash`, OAuth, and `_`-prefixed routes show the nav links
  without a tree.

  Below it, the current path's ancestry renders as a single expanded tree,
  identical for list (portal) and content pages: each ancestor level lists
  its sibling directories and the branch toward where you are opens one
  level deeper, down to the current node — a content page is highlighted
  among its siblings, a portal directory is highlighted and expanded so its
  own children show below it. The directory you're in always renders as a
  labelled node (viewing `/crowi/rfc/0002` surfaces `rfc/` rather than a
  bare page list). Navigating to an ancestor portal keeps the surrounding
  tree in place instead of collapsing to its children. Portal directories
  carry a compass icon.

  A user space (`/user/{username}/…`, including the my-page / bookmarks /
  created-pages routes) is topped with that user's home as a node — their
  avatar (uploaded image, else a generated fallback) — and roots there with
  no "⤴", since the roster is reached from the nav links; the member
  directory itself is never shown as a tree node.

  Backed by a new `GET /pages/children` endpoint that aggregates the
  immediate child segments under a path server-side (respecting page grant
  and draft visibility), returning the complete first-level set rather than
  a paginated slice.

- deb6a26: Require email confirmation for self-registration.

  When a user signs up themselves (open registration), the account is no
  longer activated immediately. Registration now creates a pending account
  and emails a signed activation link (localized MJML template); the public
  `/activate?token=…` page confirms the address via `POST /auth/activate`
  and signs the user in. Login is blocked with an "email not confirmed"
  message until then.

  Accounts created by an admin invite, by the installer, or by an admin
  are treated as already confirmed (the invite link itself proves email
  control), so those flows are unchanged. Restricted-registration mode
  still gates on admin approval.

  BREAKING: `POST /auth/register` no longer returns auth tokens; it returns
  `{ status: 'confirmation_required' | 'approval_required' }` and the user
  must confirm their email (or await approval) before signing in.

- b8c067b: Rename a page together with its whole subtree

  `POST /pages/rename` now accepts an `include_descendants` flag. When set, the
  page is moved together with every grant-visible descendant under it: paths are
  rewritten to the new base, redirects are created from each old (non-portal)
  path, and the original timestamps are preserved so a bulk move does not flood
  the "recently updated" list. Destination collisions and invalid names are
  detected up-front and returned as a structured `PAGE_RENAME_TREE_FAILED` 400
  that names the offending paths. The response also reports `renamed_count`.

  In the rename dialog, the "move subpages together" switch is now wired up: it
  moves the subtree, navigates to the new path, shows how many pages moved, and
  lists any conflicting paths on failure.

- ab063fe: Realtime collaborative editing (RFC-0003) v2.1 alpha is now available. The page editor (`/_edit?page_id=<pageId>`) runs in a Google Docs-style realtime co-editing mode where multiple users can edit the same page simultaneously. It ships with Hocuspocus attached in-process as the `@crowi/collab` library, so `/collab/*` WebSockets are handled on the same host as the api (no separate process to start).

  The `@crowi/api-contract` minor bump is for `GET /api/v2/pages/:id/yjs-token` (wsToken issuance) and the new `savedBy` / `contributors` fields on the `Revision` schema.

  Main features:

  - Live cursors / awareness display visualise other members' cursor positions and selection ranges in realtime. An `Alice (with Bob, Carol)` style contributors display is also added to the revision history.
  - Save = checkpoint model: an explicit Save button creates a `Revision`; autosave is intentionally absent. `renderedAst` is updated at the same time via `Revision.prepareRevision` (RFC-0002).
  - Concurrent-editor cap of 20 (configurable with `COLLAB_MAX_EDITORS_PER_PAGE`). The 21st editor and beyond receive live updates in read-only mode.
  - In multi-instance deployments `@hocuspocus/extension-redis` auto-attaches when `REDIS_URL` is set, doing pub/sub across all api replicas without sticky sessions.
  - Persistence is a 3-layer structure: `Page.yjsState` (live snapshot) / `PageYjsUpdate` (high-frequency deltas, TTL 1h) / `Revision` (checkpoint on save).

  See `apps/crowi-site/content/docs/{ja,en}/operations/realtime-collab.mdx` for operations (reverse-proxy config / required multi-instance env / 2-instance smoke test), `apps/crowi-site/content/docs/{ja,en}/realtime-editing.mdx` for the user-facing guide, and `docs/rfcs/0003-realtime-collaborative-editing.md` for the design rationale.

- 87f35d4: Editor UX enhancement (RFC-0004) v2.2 is now available. Four features were added on top of the minimal CodeMirror 6 editor introduced in RFC-0003, lifting the editor from "usable" to "productive".

  Main features:

  - **Autocomplete**: `@` + characters suggests users, `[[` + characters suggests pages, in a dropdown under the cursor. Three-way separation of display / insert / view (insertion uses the canonical `@username` / `[[/full/path]]` forms), 100ms debounce, LRU cache + a footer Refresh, suppressed inside code blocks / math / link syntax and at mobile widths.
  - **Paste handler**: smart-converts a single pasted URL to `[text](url)` / autolink, uploads image blobs to `POST /api/v2/attachments/upload` with auto-naming `pasted-<ts>.<ext>`, and updates an `![Uploading…(%)…]()` placeholder in-place via a Yjs transaction.
  - **Drag & drop upload**: dropping files uploads with progress at the cursor position and inserts a reference (images `![](url)` / others `[](url)`), processes multiple files serially, and is disabled in read-only mode.
  - **Draft pages**: a new page starts as `Page.status: 'draft'` and transitions one-way to `'published'` on save. `POST/GET/DELETE /api/v2/pages/drafts`, same-path conflicts return 409 + owner info, with a `/me/creating-pages` management view. Drafts are author-only and excluded from listing / search / collab.
  - **Toast notification utility**: a minimal `notify.info/warn/error` shared by the above.

  The `@crowi/api-contract` minor bump is for the new autocomplete / drafts / attachment-upload contracts and the added `status` field on the `Page` schema. Uploads enforce a 20/min/user rate limit, size caps (paste 10MB / D&D 50MB), and a file-type allow-list.

  See `apps/crowi-site/content/docs/ja/guide/` (`attachments.mdx` / `pages.mdx` / `markdown.mdx`) for the user-facing guide, `apps/crowi-site/content/docs/ja/operations/storage.mdx` for operator upload limits, and `docs/rfcs/0004-editor-ux-enhancement.md` for the design rationale.

- be5fcee: Page presence & header UI (RFC-0005) v2.2 is now available. A live presence row showing "who is viewing right now" in realtime was added to the page view, and the header meta row was restructured into unified clickable chips.

  Main features:

  - **Live presence row**: above the page title, shows realtime avatars of the users currently viewing the page. Anyone with the realtime co-editing editor open gets a `✏️` badge. Up to 5 avatars + a `[+N]` popover (20-item cap), with your own marked "(you)". The whole row is hidden when you're the only one; on narrow screens it collapses to a `[👁 N]` chip that expands into a sheet. New joins are smoothed in with a 3-second anti-flicker delay.
  - **Restructured meta-chip row**: the static author / updated-time elements plus the four like / view / comment / backlink items are converted into unified `[icon][count][label]` clickable chips. Like and view open modals; comment and backlink smooth-scroll to the relevant section + focus its heading. count=0 is greyed out + non-interactive + tooltip. Pressing the like button optimistically updates the chip count (reverting via toast on failure).
  - **"Who liked" modal**: a new modal shaped like the existing "who viewed" modal. The v1.x viewer avatar stack is removed and replaced by the view chip + modal.
  - **Presence WebSocket / endpoints**: added `GET /api/v2/pages/:id/presence-token` (short-lived JWT issuance) and a `/presence/:pageId` WebSocket. Like RFC-0003's `/collab`, the WebSocket attaches to the api process's `http.Server` in `ws noServer` mode, needing no separate process or port. Viewer state is a Redis hash and multi-instance propagation reuses the existing Redis via pub/sub (no dedicated infra). `isEditing` is computed by joining against RFC-0003's editor-cap Set at broadcast time.

  The `@crowi/api-contract` minor bump is for the new endpoints (`GET /pages/:id/presence-token` / `GET /pages/:id/likers`) and the presence WebSocket message schema.

  See `apps/crowi-site/content/docs/{ja,en}/guide/pages.mdx` for the user-facing guide, `apps/crowi-site/content/docs/{ja,en}/operations/realtime-collab.mdx` for the operator `/presence/*` reverse-proxy note, and `docs/rfcs/0005-page-presence.md` for the design rationale.

- 088f922: Add self-service password reset.

  Users who forget their password can now request a reset link from the
  sign-in page. `POST /auth/forgot-password` emails a signed, 1-hour reset
  link (always returns 200 to avoid revealing whether an email is
  registered); the public `/reset-password?token=…` page sets the new
  password via `POST /auth/reset-password` and signs the user in. The reset
  email reuses the localized MJML template (en / ja).

- 97e6543: Introduce a shared error-code contract so the server returns stable identifiers and the web app localizes them.

  `@crowi/api-contract` now ships an `ErrorCode` ledger (`ERROR_CODES` / `ErrorCodeSchema` / `type ErrorCode`) and `ApiErrorSchema.error.code` is typed as `ErrorCodeSchema` instead of a free-form string. Every modern Hono handler now returns an `ErrorCode`, so the API can only emit known codes, and the web app maps each code to a paraglide message through an exhaustive `Record<ErrorCode, MessageFn>` — adding a code without a localization is a compile error. The me and public auth forms (login / register / reset-password / invite accept) route their error display through this helper, so localized copy replaces the raw English server message. Because `@crowi/api-contract` is in a linked group, `@crowi/api` and `@crowi/web` bump together. Mail i18n (recipient `User.lang`) is unchanged, and the legacy `status:'error'` envelope is left as-is.

- 10ac192: Add a light / dark / system theme switch. The app already shipped a full set
  of `.dark` design tokens but had no way to activate them; this wires them up
  and covers the rendering that lives outside the token system.

  - **Theme toggle** — a system / light / dark switch in the header user menu
    and on the sign-in screen (next to the language switcher), backed by
    `next-themes` (`class` strategy, `system` default). The selection persists
    and is applied before hydration, so there is no flash of the wrong theme on
    reload (no FOUC, no hydration warning). `system` follows the OS setting.
  - **Token-driven UI** — activating `.dark` switches the whole shadcn +
    `--crowi-*` surface (background, text, borders, buttons, alerts, avatars,
    header, sidebar) and `color-scheme` aligns native UI (scrollbars, form
    controls) to the theme.
  - **Outside-the-tokens rendering** — Shiki code blocks render dual-theme via
    CSS variables (`--shiki-light` / `--shiki-dark`) so highlighting follows the
    theme; the CodeMirror editor, the page-history diff viewer, and sonner
    toasts all track the active theme. KaTeX inherits `currentColor`.
  - **Cross-device persistence** — the chosen theme is stored on the user
    account (`User.theme`) via a dedicated `PATCH /me/theme` and reconciled on
    load, so the preference follows the user across devices rather than living
    only in per-device localStorage.
  - **Fixed-colour diagrams** — server-generated PlantUML (and future Mermaid)
    SVGs keep their baked-in colours; under dark mode they are wrapped in a
    neutral light background so they stay legible.

- 4594ad2: Notifications are now driven solely by explicit page watchers, and participating in a page auto-subscribes you.

  Previously the notification audience for comments / likes was an implicit set (the page creator plus everyone who had ever commented or edited the page) unioned with explicit WATCH watchers. A one-time editor of a page they did not watch could therefore keep receiving notifications and could only stop by explicitly ignoring the page.

  The audience is now exactly the explicit `WATCH` watchers, minus `IGNORE` opt-outs, minus the acting user, minus inactive users. To keep the effective reach the same while making it controllable, participation now materialises a real watcher row:

  - Creating a page or saving a new revision auto-watches the acting user. This covers both HTTP saves and realtime (collab) saves, which flow through the same page-save event.
  - Commenting auto-watches the commenter. The add-comment response now returns `newlyWatching: boolean`; when it is `true` the web UI shows a one-shot "you're now watching this page" hint with a stop-watching action.
  - An existing `IGNORE` row is always respected — auto-watch never flips an opt-out back to watching.
  - Liking a page does not auto-watch.

  `getWatchStatus` now reports watch state purely from the presence of a watcher row (the previous derive-from-implicit-set fallback is removed), so the watch toggle is the single source of truth. No schema change; existing pages are not backfilled (auto-watch applies to new activity going forward).

### Patch Changes

- 9c55f6c: Fix other users' draft pages leaking into the page list. The `include_deleted` query param used `z.coerce.boolean()`, which is JS `Boolean(v)` — so the string `"false"` (how the web client serialises `false` on the query string) coerced to `true`. That flipped `include_deleted` on for every listing request, making the server skip the draft/status visibility filter and return drafts owned by anyone, not just the viewer. The param now parses the string explicitly so only `"true"` / `true` is truthy.
- 9899d5f: Narrow `User.lang` to the live `en` / `ja` locales. The legacy regional
  variants (`en-US` / `en-GB`) were retired — only `en` and `ja` ship UI
  messages — so the language enum (`LanguageSchema` / `UserLanguageSchema`),
  the Mongoose enum, and the `User.lang` type are all tightened to `en` / `ja`,
  and the new-user default moves from `en-US` to `en`.

  Existing rows that still hold a legacy value are handled without a data
  migration: they are normalised to `en` on read (`GET /me`) and coerced on
  write via a `User` `pre('validate')` hook, so the tightened enum never
  rejects a save. Also fixes a latent copy-paste bug where the `User.LANG_EN_GB`
  model static was assigned the `en-US` value.
